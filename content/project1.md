This is a project page, not an explanatory essay page. The page should present two parallel main projects under the broader research area of high-redshift black holes and AGNs. Do not over-emphasize Little Red Dots as the only project. Keep sections tied directly to project entries, sub-work, authors, covers, and references.

**Main Project 1: Origin and evolution of Little Red Dots**

JWST has opened an uncharted frontier of the Universe, revealing phenomena that challenge our understanding of galaxy formation and the origin of supermassive black holes. Among its most intriguing discoveries are the Little Red Dots (LRDs): compact sources characterized by blue UV emission, red optical continua, broad emission lines in some cases, and inferred black-hole-to-stellar mass ratios that exceed both local scaling relations and the predictions of current cosmological simulations. Their abrupt emergence and equally rapid disappearance over the narrow redshift interval z ~ 5-8 make their origin and subsequent evolution particularly enigmatic.

Where do they come from, and where do they go? Under the supervision of Prof. Kohei Inayoshi (https://inayoshi0328.wixsite.com/kohei-inayoshi), a leading researcher in the theoretical modeling of LRDs, and Prof. Fangzhou Jiang (https://www.fzjiang.com), an expert in cosmology and structure formation, I am developing a coherent research program that seeks to understand both where LRDs come from and what they ultimately become, connecting their physical origin to the black-hole populations observed in the later Universe within a cosmological framework.

Assembly bias provides valuable insight into the formation pathways of galaxies with extreme morphologies. A number of scenarios have been proposed to explain LRDs' cosmological statistical origin, particularly in terms of the properties required of their host DM halos. However, while assembly bias has been extensively studied in cosmological simulations at low redshift, its behavior in the early Universe (z >= 5) remains poorly understood. In this work, we extend measurements of halo assembly bias associated with halo age, concentration, and spin, properties closely related to proposed formation pathways of LRDs. We apply these results, for the first time, to LRD formation scenarios by populating halos with LRDs according to the aforementioned models.

1. Characterizes early-Universe halo assembly bias in the Shin-Uchuu cosmological N-body simulation.
2. Tracks how formation time, concentration, and spin change clustering at fixed mass, and how those signals evolve toward high redshift.
3. Applies the bias model to LRD scenarios: direct-collapse black holes, low-spin compact galaxies, SIDM core-collapse halos, and primordial black holes.
4. Finds that the DCBH scenario predicts the strongest large-scale bias and enhanced pair fractions, while low-spin/SIDM scenarios are weaker and PBH-like initiation is close to unbiased.

**How Little Red Dots Turn Blue: Evolution of Hydrostatic Black Hole Envelopes, Transition Timescales, and Observational Diagnostics**

Key authors: Zihao Wang, Kohei Inayoshi*

Another population of compact blue broad-line AGN at similar redshifts, sometimes discussed as "Little Blue Dots" (LBD-like systems), may represent a closely related population. This immediately raises a key question: are LRDs and LBDs primarily different evolutionary stages of the same underlying black hole growth process, or are they largely coexisting manifestations produced by different viewing geometries? Put differently, does the emerging taxonomy of little dots encode time evolution, orientation, or some combination of both? This question is important because the answer determines whether the diversity of compact broad-line sources at high redshift should be interpreted mainly as a dynamical sequence or as a unification problem.

In this work, we analyze the black hole and its surrounding dense envelope, which are fed by gas inflow from the host, while radiative and mechanical feedback from the accretion flow act back on the envelope structure. We construct a simple time-dependent model for the joint evolution of the black hole and its surrounding envelope:

1. Develops a self-consistent model for a Kelvin-Helmholtz contracting gaseous envelope surrounding a growing black hole, with feedback regulating the dispersal of the envelope.
2. Predicts spectral continuum signatures throughout transitional evolutionary phases.
3. Uses the observed contrasts among LRDs, Little Blue Dots, and normal AGNs to constrain black-hole feedback prescriptions.

**Main Project 2: Tracking AGN accretion histories in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations**

The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is fundamentally governed by their accretion histories. AGN proximity zones during the Epoch of Reionization provide one of the few direct probes of recent SMBH accretion histories through the response of the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). However, interpreting these observations is challenging because proximity-zone sizes depend not only on the intrinsic accretion history of the AGN, but also on AGN variability and lifetime, ionizing radiation from neighboring galaxies and AGN, and line-of-sight density fluctuations. Bridging SMBH growth with the observational signatures encoded in proximity zones therefore requires realistic cosmological simulations that capture both AGN variability and the evolving cosmic environment.

AGN proximity zones provide a direct probe of both the ionization state of the IGM and the recent growth history of SMBHs. However, their interpretation is complicated by AGN variability, finite lifetime, environmental ionization from nearby galaxies and AGN, and line-of-sight density fluctuations.

We're using the LUMINA simulation to study AGN proximity zones of hydrogen at z ~ 6-7 and helium at z ~ 3-4. We will measure HI and HeIII proximity-zone sizes around simulated AGN and connect them to the instantaneous luminosity, accretion history, and lifetime of the central SMBH. In particular, we will follow the time-dependent evolution of ionization fronts to test how long proximity zones retain memory of previous AGN activity and whether bursty and continuous accretion histories leave distinguishable signatures. We will also quantify how neighboring galaxies, AGN, large-scale environment, and line-of-sight density fluctuations affect the measured proximity-zone size, thereby assessing how reliably observed proximity zones can be interpreted as tracers of SMBH growth.

By connecting proximity-zone measurements to realistic SMBH growth histories and environments, this project will provide a physically motivated framework for interpreting current and future observations, and help establish AGN proximity zones as a powerful probe of both black-hole evolution and the topology of cosmic reionization.
